# The Robot Project

## General remarks

* Since no other libraries and tools than plain JDK and a testing framework should be used and it should be compiled using either Idea or Eclipse, this repository contains just the java sources and IntelliJ Idea project files.
* In a production project I would prefer to use at least Maven/Gradle.
