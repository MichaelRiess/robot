# The Robot Project

## General remarks

* Since no other libraries and tools than plain JDK and a testing framework should be used and it should be compiled using either Idea or Eclipse, this repository contains just the java sources and IntelliJ Idea project files.
* In a production project I would prefer to use at least Maven/Gradle.
* The Room interface described in the assignment is not really needed for the requested functionality, so I left it out. 
* Since no specifications were made about what happens when the robot encounters a "wall", it simply moves on an unbounded grid for the time being.
